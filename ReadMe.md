# Shoyu Ramen

This is a custom WordPress theme that I designed in Figma, and then developed from scratch. Its purpose is to demonstrate
knowledge and experience of WordPress theme development using template files, The Loop, post types, WordPress hooks and functions.


## How This Project Was Designed

Before coding I used Figma to design the basic feel and layout of the mobile layout for the front page.

I then used Figma to design the basic feel and layout of the desktop layout for the front page.

* While these designs were followed as closely as possible, there were a few adjustments made along the development
process to make a better user experience. These changes were subtle UI/UX changes (box shadows for buttons, font sizing
adjustments for smallest screen sizes, etc).

## Obstacles I Faced

During development I used template files, instead of Gutenberg or Elementor so that I would learn more about WordPress file
heirarchy and post manipulation. Template files were first hand coded and then adjusted with Advanced Custom Fields and template parts to offer users a way to dynamically adjust content. Though there are different, and arguably more popular methods of theme development alternatives as previously mentioned, they would have sacrificed this learning experience for the sake of their benefits to development.
